# How To Contribute
## Suggestions
Open an issue and use the `Suggestion` label. I will review it and respond, simple as. If it gets implemented, you get credited. If it doesn't, it gets closed and that's the end of it.
## Code changes
Just make a pull request. It may take a while to be reviewed, but I will probably review it. If it gets implemented, you get credited, and if not, you don't.
## General Inquiries
Send me an email at `winfan3672@gmail.com` or just open an issue. The latter is more likely to get my attention.
