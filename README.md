# OpenLife
An open-source [hence the name] life simulator inspired by BitLife written in Python.
# What Is It
It is an attempt at recreating the BitLife environment in Python, while keeping all functionality open-source. 
For years BitLife has suffered from:
- Lazy Development
- Paywalls
- Subscription services
- Garbage spin-off apps that are ovbious cash grabs
- Functionality in the "God Mode" getting removed, making it weaker and weaker
