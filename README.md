# OpenLife
An open-source [hence the name] life simulator inspired by BitLife written in Python.
# What Is It
It is an attempt at recreating the BitLife environment in Python, while keeping all functionality open-source. 
For years BitLife has suffered from:
- Lazy Development
- Paywalls
- Subscription services
- Garbage spin-off apps that are ovbious cash grabs
- Functionality in the "God Mode" getting removed, making it weaker and weaker

## How finished is it?
Not very. I just started. I need to add a lot of things.
Most people do not realise it, but there are a lot of moving parts in BitLife, making it quite an ambitious project to recreate it.
## What can I do so far?
- You can live a full life now [up to 130 if you keep respawning]
- Go to University and get a degree
- Get a job and earn money
- Have [0] Children
- Have [0] Generations of children
- Gamble
- Play the lottery [and win trillions]
- Retire
- Nothing much, really

The game is far from complete for a reason.

### LifeSimulator1
Ah, yes, from my good friend `fungamer2`. Great project. Bigger team, smaller game, growing faster, has a better library. Also, I put forward a few ideas for the project, not to blow my own trumpet.
